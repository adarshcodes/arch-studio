## My process

- First of all create a React project (because I'm working of React).
- Remove all the unesassary files and all my own files and folders to create a better architecture.
- Add font awesome and Google fonts to every website I develope.
- Setup Sass
- And from here I begin to write the story of the websiteüòã

### Built with

- Love ‚ù§Ô∏èüòã
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

In this project I've learned a lot and some of the things I'll take from this project are:

- Routing (obviously)
- File Architecture and Sass
- Using Helmet Library to change the title of the page while routing

### Useful resources

- [Implementing Open Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62Y8SFi2wBk) - This helped me for implementing the Leaflet Map in React. I really liked this video and I think it will help you.
